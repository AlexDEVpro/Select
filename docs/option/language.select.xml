			This is a container object for the language strings used by Select:

			* `s-init language.select.rows` - Table summary information, row count string
			* `s-init language.select.columns` - Table summary information, column count string
			* `s-init language.select.cells` - Table summary information, cell count string

		Select provides a number of different built in ways that an end user can interact with the selection of items in the table, which is controlled by this parameter (and `s-api select.style()` after initialisation).

		The default mode of operation is based on the selection of files in modern operating systems with the ctrl/cmd and shift keys can be user to provide complex operations.

		Note that while the `-string api` option disables item selection via Select's built in event handler, it is quote possible to use the API to still provide the end user with the ability to select / deselect items based on your own event handlers.
